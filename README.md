Read-only [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database assets for Unity.

Automatically imports ".sqlite", ".sqlite2" and ".sqlite3" files as SQLite database assets.


## Features
- [SqliteAsset](Runtime/SqliteAsset.cs): read-only SQLite database Unity assets.
  + Files with the extensions ".sqlite", ".sqlite2" and ".sqlite3" will be imported as SQLite database assets.
  + Use the `CreateConnection()` method for connecting to the database provided by the asset.
    Make sure to `Dispose()` of any connections you create.
  + SQLite assets may be loaded from Streaming Assets folder or from memory, depending on the value of their "Streaming Assets Path" property.
  + **Warning**: Android and WebGL platforms don't support loading SQLite databases from Streaming Assets and will always load them in memory.
- `SQLiteConnection.SerializeToAsset` extension method for serializing a database to an instance of `SqliteAsset`.
